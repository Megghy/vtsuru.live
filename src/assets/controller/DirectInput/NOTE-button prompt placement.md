## Regarding DirectInput prompts

Due to the way DirectInput buttons are approached; The order of the face button across various DirectInput-compatible Game Controller may not be consistent. This button prompt theme is best used for HOTAS or Racing Wheels. Although: **this theme will provide *up* to 32 Buttons Icons**. 

If using newer Input APIs such as SDL_GameController or Windows GameInput: We recommend using the "Shared" theme as a way to handle generic game controllers.
